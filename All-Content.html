        Capability of Drones for Humanitarian Purposes in Ukraine
    </b></em></h2>

    <p>
    The use of drones is undoubtedly a new development in warfare recently and has been inredibly highlighted in the war involving Ukraine and Russia. The immediate plan of action as it seems for both countries regarding drones has been to use it for what you may think - war purposes. However, as of, a new spin on the use of drones came when someone came up with the idea to use it for humanitarian themed missions such as medical related missions. This could include search and rescue operations for example. Immediately, one may go, perfect, it is a great idea and I bet it will be successful. However, there are some unprecedented fallbacks with some humanitarian themed missions, especially with missions that involve the actual humans interacting with them, this interaction could be just a simple sight. So now the question remains, can these drones actually be used for humanitarian purposes effectively in war time, or is it too conflicted to be succesful? … Finish this.
